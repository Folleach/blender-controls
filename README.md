I like blender ui and user experience.  
Therefore, I created this repository, in which implemented some [Blender interface elements](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/index.html) on [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

#### Try it

```bash
npm run storybook
```

#### Roadmap

- [x] workspace manager
    - [x] render areas
    - [x] move areas
    - [x] split areas
    - [ ] join areas
    - [ ] store workspace layouts
- [ ] menus
- [ ] consecutive keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] node editor
- [ ] routine buttons, etc...

This project is **under development**.  
Unsuitable for production
